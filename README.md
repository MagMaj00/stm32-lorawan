# STM32 LoraWan

Embedded Systems IOT project that utilizes STM32 L152 Nucleo and USI STM32 to create a two-way LoRa message exchange.

Developed for IOT: Internet of Things course @ WUT Warsaw University of
Technology.

about the project.

# Features

- BME280 Sensor to read surrounding's general temperature and pressure
- [SEN0193](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Capacitive_Soil_Moisture_Sensor_SKU_SEN0193) Sensor to measure soil moisture levels
- Request to measuring SLAVE is sent only when button on MASTER board is pressed,

# Built with

- STM32 L152 Nucleo-64 development board,
- USI STM32 Nucleo expansion board for LoRa,
- BME280 I2C/SPI breakout board,

## Future development note

- [Issue] Debugging with current PlatformIO configuration don't work properly
- [Issue] Sending larger number of bytes
